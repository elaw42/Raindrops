**Raindrops** is a game in which the player tries to catch raindrops.  The score goes up with each raindrop caught, but the game ends when too many raindrops fall onto the floor.  There is an easy mode and hard mode in the game.  In the easy mode, there are only raindrops and if you lose 250, then you will lose.  In hard mode the twist is that there are **acid raindrops** that could spoil the rain already caught.  Catching those or losing 1000 raindrops will automatically end the game.  Try to get a high score.

The catcher is controlled by the mouse.  The rain comes down randomly at timed intervals.  Press t to toggle the background, p for the pause screen, and n for the net in the main game.  Have fun (not really).

When the game is reset from the end game screen the raindrops do not reset their position.
