**Raindrops** is a game in which the player tries to catch raindrops.  The score goes up with each raindrop caught, but the game ends when too many raindrops fall onto the floor.  The twist is that there are **acid raindrops** that could spoil the rain already caught.  Catching those will automatically end the game.

The catcher is controlled by the arrow keys.  The rain comes down randomly.  Have fun (not really).
